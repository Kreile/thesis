- Publication Bias publikationen, litterature review

- Publication date  - Publication bias? Weshalb nicht publikations-sample size mit publikations-Jahr vertauschen oder ergänzen? 

Comparisons:
- Pooled effect size and corrected pooled effect size difference vs. - ? (pbias test, added studies, heterogeneity, ..)
- Significance of pooled effect sizes and ? (corrected pooled effect size significance, subgroup analysis pooled effect size, ..)

- Crossover trials given in dataset? 

- Meta-analysis with survival outcomes?

- How to deal with sparse data (binary outcomes)? e.g. metabin(incr = "TACC")
Currently, e(t) = 0 and e(c) = 0 is used as exclusion criteria. If only one is 0,
incr = 0.5 is used (default in metabin() function)

- How to handle between study heterogeneity? Some tests have been shown to work only well if heterogeneity is present? Automatic discrimination in test use for a more exact assessment of publication bias?

- How to proceed with trim and fill? Has been shown multiple times to be more conservative than other methods

- General approach: How to use dataset - also like a simulation dataset, to exploit properties of tests and methods? Because the properties found very likely will reflect future properties, and there could be some benefit from knowledge of such benefits.
Also, is restriction to publication bias necessary?

- Use bland altmann plots to compare p-values of pbias tests.

- Replace correlation btw. p-values with Rsquared.

- Ist outcome nr 1 das primary outcome?
Daten wurden mit Reviews verglichen - outcome.nr 1 ist oft das primary outcome.
Primary outcome ist outcome.nr 1: file.nr 21, 33, 130
Primary outcome ist outcome.nr 1: file.nr 4050
Primary outcome ist outcome.nr 1,2,3,4: file.nr 3465
Primary outcome ist outcome.nr 1,2, ..~8: file.nr 4450
Primary outcome ist outcome.nr 1,2, ..9: file.nr 440
Primary outcome ist outcome.nr 1,2: file.nr 3480, 1040
aber in file.nr 3480 comparison 5 outcome.nr 1 sind adverse effects.


- doi from review to doi from studies to study characteristics

- There is the possibility that a study is once given as odds ratio, once as risk ratio..

- Do a meta analysis part (i.e. analyze all studies with one or more replicas by meta-analysis methods)
For this, extend the dataset with fishersz correlation and variance, p-values (and more?).
Then compare significance of single trials with significance of meta analysis (plot overall fraction of significant trials against fraction of significant meta analyses).

- Hartung Knapp is not always conservative compared to fixef (Cochrane MEthods 2016)
