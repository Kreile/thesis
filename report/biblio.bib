@article{Copas2,
	Abstract = {{Publication bias is a major problem, perhaps the major problem, in meta-analysis (or systematic reviews). Small
 studies are more likely to be published if their results are
 `significant' than if their results are negative or
 inconclusive, and so the studies available for review are biased in
 favour of those with positive outcomes. Correcting for this bias is
 not possible without making untestable assumptions. In this paper, a
 sensitivity analysis is suggested which is based on fitting a model
 to the funnel plot. Some examples are discussed.*To whom correspondence should be addressed. jbc@stats.warwick.ac.uk}},

@article{Egger,
	Abstract = {Objective: Funnel plots (plots of effect estimates against sample size) may be useful to detect bias in meta-analyses that were later contradicted by large trials. We examined whether a simple test of asymmetry of funnel plots predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared to large trials, and we assessed the prevalence of bias in published meta-analyses. Design: Medline search to identify pairs consisting of a meta-analysis and a single large trial (concordance of results was assumed if effects were in the same direction and the meta-analytic estimate was within 30\% of the trial); analysis of funnel plots from 37 meta-analyses identified from a hand search of four leading general medicine journals 1993-6 and 38 meta-analyses from the second 1996 issue of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. Main outcome measure: Degree of funnel plot asymmetry as measured by the intercept from regression of standard normal deviates against precision. Results: In the eight pairs of meta-analysis and large trial that were identified (five from cardiovascular medicine, one from diabetic medicine, one from geriatric medicine, one from perinatal medicine) there were four concordant and four discordant pairs. In all cases discordance was due to meta-analyses showing larger effects. Funnel plot asymmetry was present in three out of four discordant pairs but in none of concordant pairs. In 14 (38\%) journal meta-analyses and 5 (13\%) Cochrane reviews, funnel plot asymmetry indicated that there was bias. Conclusions: A simple analysis of funnel plots provides a useful test for the likely presence of bias in meta-analyses, but as the capacity to detect bias will be limited when meta-analyses are based on a limited number of small trials the results from such analyses should be treated with considerable caution. Key messages Systematic reviews of randomised trials are the best strategy for appraising evidence; however, the findings of some meta-analyses were later contradicted by large trialsFunnel plots, plots of the trials{\textquoteright} effect estimates against sample size, are skewed and asymmetrical in the presence of publication bias and other biasesFunnel plot asymmetry, measured by regression analysis, predicts discordance of results when meta-analyses are compared with single large trialsFunnel plot asymmetry was found in 38\% of meta-analyses published in leading general medicine journals and in 13\% of reviews from the Cochrane Database of Systematic ReviewsCritical examination of systematic reviews for publication and related biases should be considered a routine procedure},

@article{tau.estimator,
	Abstract = {This paper examines eight published reviews each reporting results from several related trials. Each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. These reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. We discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. This approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. The model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. We suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies.},
