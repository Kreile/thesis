Aim to assess when pb tests are not meaningful or inappropriate:

- Exclusion of results with no or total events (- 906 (meta analyses ?))

- Exclusion of meta-analysis with same number of events, totals and summary measures (-761)

- Exclusion of meta-analyses w n = 2

-> Left with 6873 studies

restricted dataset (largest m.a. per review): -> 846




- Three quarters or more have fewer than 10 studies

- 1/2 or 1/3 (r) w no significant results

- 1/5 or 1/4 sig. or large (I2 > 0.5) heterogeneity

- 1/4 or 1/5 had variance ratio > 4

- 366 (5%) or 98 (12%) fullfill all criteria

Pb.test results:
- harbord 12 or 13%
- egger 15 and 18%
- begg 7 and 9%
- 3 or 4% sig. with any test
- 19 and 22% siw. w at least one
- kappa begg-egger 0.6 and egger-thompson 0.59


- In 60 meta-analyses from literature - inappropriate interpretation, use and declaration of tests. 

"gave a signal with any of the 3 tests; 3%Ð4% gave consistent signals for asymmetry with all diagnostics. --> In the absence of a criterion standard about the presence of publication bias, it is impossible to decide whether these figures were low because the tests we examined were underpowered or because publication bias is uncommon."

- It is also emphasized that "very large sample size ("missleading funnel plot.." Tang Liu J Clin Epi 2000) increased attention to the research question and heightened interest in CONTRACTIDING PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS with extreme opposite results may contribute as much or more than statistical significance to dictating publication in selected cases or in entire scientific fields (Ioannidis "Early extreme contradictory.." J Clin Epi 2005)

- There are evaluations oh whether the Cochrane Library is representative for the field
